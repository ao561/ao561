<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Amaan 👋</h1>

<p align="left">
  I'm an Information and Computer Engineering student at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge with a strong interest in software engineering, machine learning and quantitative development.
  
  This summer, I will be joining Morgan Stanley for a 12-month placement as a Software Engineer, where I look forward to developing in an enterprise-scale environment and driving results on high-impact engineering projects.
  
  I’m always open to new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities across the technology landscape.
